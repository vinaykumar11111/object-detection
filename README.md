This project demonstrates object detection using the YOLOv8 model with a pre-recorded video file and also by real-time vide capture. It uses the `ultralytics` library for YOLO, `opencv-python` for handling video capture and display, and `cvzone` for additional OpenCV functionalities.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to install the following Python packages:

- `ultralytics==8.2.0`
- `opencv-python==4.10.0`
- `cvzone==1.5.1`

You can install these dependencies using pip. The recommended way is to use the `requirements.txt` file provided.
